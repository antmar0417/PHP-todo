        <p class="mb-2 text-sm">The best time to make a daily to do list is either the night before, or first thing in the morning. The biggest benefit of a well organized to do list is the peace of mind that comes with having a plan in place. Going to bed with a plan for the next day in place can lead to better sleep. Making a list first thing in the morning will give you a plan for a successful day.</p>

        <summary class="mb-2 font-bold">How many items should be on a to do list?</summary>
        <p class="mb-2 text-sm">It's important to keep your to do list manageable. An impossible task list can increase feelings of stress. It is often recommended to keep to do lists to 3 items maximum. If you need to have more than 3 items, try to include no more than 1 "big" task and fill the list out with some "medium" or "small" tasks that are easy to accomplish.</p>
